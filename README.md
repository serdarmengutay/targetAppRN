# targetAppRN


A game that works with the logic of 'keep a number in mind', coded with react native with the help of expo, and contains an example of how to switch from screen to screen without using react-navigation. As a user, you enter a number between 1 and 100 on the login screen, then the program tries to guess the number you specify, and the user directs the program to know the number with the + and - icons. It does not allow the user to mislead. When the program finds the number, it directs it to the game over screen and shows how many times the program has found the number and its previous predictions, the game is restarted via the button on this screen.
